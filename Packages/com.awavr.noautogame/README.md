# NoAutoGame
Prevents the Game window from opening or automatically focusing.

## How it works
There are two settings you can toggle from `Tools > AwA > NoAutoGame`
- **AutoClose:** If there was no Game window before entering playmode, then the Game window will be closed right away.
- **AutoUnfocus:** This will restore all windows' focuses to what it was before entering playmode. Additionally, if AutoClose is disabled, and there was no Game window, then it'll close the Game window upon exiting playmode.
